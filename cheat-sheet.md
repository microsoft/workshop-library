# Workshop Cheat Sheet

Here are the steps to take to host a workshop:

## Planning phase

1.  Clone this repo and select the workshop that you will present. If you would like to translate and/or localize an existing workshop, please feel free to do so, and PR your changes, preserved in the /translations folder, back to this library for review.

## Logistics phase

1. Invite your students to the workshop held on Teams, optionally using text from your [workshop designer](https://github.com/microsoft/workshop-template/blob/main/workshop/workshop-designer.md) file to explain expected student takeaways. You can design a poster about your session. There are also posters and marketing materials on Teams in the [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/) tenant for use to promoting Student Ambassadors Led workshop.
1. Gather a group of mentors and assign them groups of students if you will be teaching a large group. Meet with the mentors prior to the workshop, and walk through the suggested [mentor training](https://github.com/FrontEndFoxes/art/blob/main/frontend-foxes-mentor-training.pdf)

## Delivery phase

1. Hold the workshop on Teams, **keeping count of attendees**.
1. Start with slides, giving a presentation to introduce yourself and explain what students will discover.
1. After the presentation, walk through the workshop's root README files, explaining the milestones.

## Feedback phase 

1. Ask students in the workshop to fill out [this survey](https://forms.office.com/r/MdhJWMZthR), linked at the bottom of the workshop page. 
1. Fill in a [survey to catalogue your own experiences](https://forms.office.com/r/thfwmD0USG) as a workshop instructor using this form. We are eager to hear any feedback about the workshop, including your experience as a teacher, your mentors' experiences, and any suggestions from any participant on to improve the workshop.
1. [Log your activity via the MLSA program tools](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/ef147bae-33f7-46f2-aef2-3854cbd07b23?list=trending&referrer=https:%2F%2Fstaticsint.teams.cdn.office.net%2F).
