## Ready-to-use Presentations

This is a collection of presentation materials that you can use, adapt, and modify for *your* own presentation! It was built by Cloud Advocate at Microsoft in partnership with Microsoft Student Ambassadors.

🚀 Present in 3 easy steps:

1. Find a ready-to-use topic from [AI/ML](#-ai-and-ml), [Data](#-data-and-data-science), or [Web Development](#-web-development). For example: [Intro to Static Web Apps](./short/intro-static-web-apps/README.md)
1. Click on the link to find all resources in a single page including an optional Power Point
1. Select and modify the content to your needs, and present away!

## 🧐 Sounds interesting, what do I need?
You only need to find an available title from a topic that you like and use any (or all) resources to create a presentation. No need to know Git or GitHub unless you want to fork this repository and make changes (✅ which is OK if you want to!).


## 🤔 I'm still confused!
