					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p>I am an ambitious second-year student at Chitkara University pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. I have been working on my skills and expanding my knowledge in coding and problem-solving aspect.

                        During my first year, I gained an interest in programming, so I started learning Python & C language, and now I have a strong foundation in these languages. I learned a lot about programming while making projects like Voice Assistant in Python and Grocery Management System in C. Additionally, I have become skilled in front-end web development by working with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
                        
                        Currently, I am focusing on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the programming language, C++. I am improving my problem-solving and logic-building skills by participating in weekly coding competitions held on coding platforms like LeetCode, etc. This practice has proven valuable in enhancing my coding skills, logic-building capabilities, and problem-solving approach.
                        
                        As a beginner in the field of computer science, I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning. I am eager to connect with professionals, enthusiasts, and experts alike, as I value the opportunity to exchange ideas, gain knowledge, and grow together.
                        
                        Beyond academics and coding, I find joy in listening to songs.</p>
