## Pre-Learning

- [GitHub and GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)

## Prerequisites

This workshop will use GitHub for demonstrating the Hand-on part of the workshop. Make sure to have an active GitHub account and preferably get a GitHub Student's developer pack.

## What students will learn

This workshop primiralily focuses on GitHub Actions, but will start from absolute begining. We first introduce the audience about Git and it's purpose ##(this part is optional, you may ignore this part to reduce session length)##. Then we will move to GitHub and display basic functionality of GitHub. After demonstrating GitHub, we will introduce audience about DevOps Automation, why it is required and how they can make use of it in their projects. Now we'll move on to GitHub Actions and introduce different components of GitHub Workflow. 
Finally we'll end with a hands-on live coding part, where we will create a simple GitHub Workflow.


## Additionally Conduct a Hands-On, Live Coding workshop for GitHub Actions

You may or may not decide to conduct a hands-on workshop for GitHub Actions. If you wish to conduct, then the resources are provided [here](Intro-To-GitHub-Actions.zip).
The project contains a simple typescript express app, and workflows written in ```.github``` folder which runs tests and builds the app. It demonstractes some more Actions like replying on creating an issue and sending email. Further you may add better action by visiting GitHub Marketplace [Link](https://github.com/marketplace?type=).


## Quiz

[A simple quiz on GitHub Actions can be conducted to check knowledge and make the session interactive : )](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions)
