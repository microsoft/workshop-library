Draw automatic & accurate detection insights from datasets
Use the Custom Vision service to create an image classification solution
Customize a Power app by adding controls, images, and logic.

## Stage 2: Evidence

By the end of the workshop, students will be able to build a custom app combined with custom vision service. A quiz is embedded in the slides.

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

1. Custom Vision project build up
2. Test the model & Generate Custom Vision link
3. Link Custom Vision model and Power App
4. Layout of Power App
5. App accuracy test with new inputs
