## Workshop Template

Welcome to the Next Generation Team's design template for [building workshops](presentation.pptx), a system designed to help Microsoft Student Ambassadors and their partners to create and deliver excellent technical workshops.

## Types of Workshops

In this template you will find two types of workshops that you can build:

* **[Workshops](./workshop/README.md)** - a workshop that is designed to be completed within 30-90 minutes with content derived from [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com).
* **[Short Workshops](./short-workshop/README.md)** - a workshop that is designed to be completed within 15-30 minutes with content derived from [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com). 

## Style Guide

To present a unified voice, please use [this style guide](https://github.com/jlooper/curriculum-template/wiki/Voice) to shape your writing.

## Building a Workshop

- [ ] Discuss with Chris Noring on the topic and Learn module on which to focus for your workshop.
- [ ] Decide what kind of workshop you want to design and sync with project leads (Jen Looper and Chris Noring for workshops, Max Rouillier for short workshops) to work out details.
- [ ] Discuss your plan with your lead and add it to our DevOps board.
- [ ] Design your workshop following these steps.
    - [ ] Fork this template repo to your local machine.
    - [ ] In the folder of your chosen type of workshop, fill out the [workshop-designer](./workshop/workshop-designer.md) document to design the experience.
    - [ ] Build slides for the workshop using the appropriate template, depending on which type of workshop you are building. 
        - For Workshops, use our Particle tool to generate slides. Contact Chris Noring or Jen Looper for help.
        - For Short-form workshops, slides are optional.
    - [ ] Write instructions for your workshop based on the README.md file in your folder's template. Your README.md work is minimal, and mostly links back to the source Learn module. Make sure to include a Call to Action with an instrumented link leading back to Docs and/or Learn to learn more.
    - [ ] If your workshop needs to diverge significantly from the Learn module, write out the steps as milestones, adding images and screenshots as needed.
    - [ ] Give your folder a descriptive name and PR the folder to the Next Generation Team's workshop library using [the library's PR template](https://github.com/microsoft/workshop-library)
- [ ] Trainers: Contact Chris Noring or Jen Looper to present your workshop to Microsoft Student Ambassadors to generate a Train the Trainer video for inclusion in the library.
- [ ] Ambassadors: present workshops to your communities sourced from [the workshop library](https://github.com/microsoft/workshop-library). You can edit and use a [copy of this poster](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEuDXXR9us/share/preview?token=Je0_213uqxmYaXnNYz1v-Q&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEuDXXR9us&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) to publicize it.
