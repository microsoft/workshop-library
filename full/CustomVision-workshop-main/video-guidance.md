### Video Best Practice 

Authors: Chloe Condon and April Speight

#### Set the Scene 
Consider a neutral background for your streams. Remember, you want the viewer to focus on you and a noisy or distracting background can detract from your presentation! Here are some things to consider while setting the scene for your recording: 

Whatâ€™s in the background? Ideally, use a solid neutral background, or set up the area behind you to look clean and professional. Think of whatâ€™s behind you as a set/stage. Be aware that anything in your background can be zoomed in on & enhanced! Try to avoid highlighting any branded items behind you (other than Microsoft), and be wary of accidentally sharing any product announcements, whiteboards of internal info, other important papers, etc. that may be visible in the background. 

Example: If youâ€™re presenting in front of a book shelf, note the books, art, and other items behind you. Think of your background like a movie/television set, and make sure what is visible is appropriate for the content/aesthetic/style of the video youâ€™re recording!

#### Sound Check
Your sound quality makes a huge difference in your final recording! Take special care to make sure you sound clear and professional in your video.

Can you hear me now? Make sure to test your sound before recording! Ideally, youâ€™ll want to use a high quality headset, microphone, or other professional equipment to record your video. Always do a sound check before recording- itâ€™s better to test this before you record to make sure you donâ€™t have to re-record again with better audio. Youâ€™ll want to test audio quality for echos, extra background noises, microphone placement, etc. 

Tip ðŸ’¡: Avoid using wired cellphone headphones with the mic on the cord- the microphone will move/rub against clothing as you move, and cause sound issues that are difficult to fix in post. 

#### Costumes
Think of your outfit for videos like a costume- does what you're wearing match the tone of the video you're recording? Remember- you're representing Microsoft! Take time to choose clothing that will showcase you and the company in the best light.

Always consider what youâ€™re wearing when filming, just as you would with a live talk on stage! Think of your outfit like a costume. You should avoid any brands/logos (other than Microsoft) when possible, avoid bold/distracting/intricate patterns, and try to wear a contrasting color to your background (example: a red shirt on a red background may create a floating head effect). 

Tip ðŸ’¡: Using a green screen? Make sure to avoid any green clothing! 

#### Lights
Make sure you have proper lighting for your video (we literally want to see you and showcase you in your best light)! Recording a video at night vs. day time can make a huge difference in how you look on camera, and will require some extra time, tools, and steps to make sure you're seen on screen. Remember- there's a reason why they award people Oscars & Tonys for lighting design- it's truly an art!

Consider using external lighting tools, and make sure you're lighting your face/from behind your camera/computer/recording device! Even many cheap light tools available online provide you with different modes/brightness settings, and options. You'll need to adjust this for each stream, as lighting always varies by time of day, room, etc!
There are many different kinds of light! Things like overhead fluorescents, natural lighting, and more can change the entire look of your presentation. Many lighting tools provide warm vs. bright light, and allow you to adjust brightness.
Ask your manager about what tools and resources are available to expense! 

#### Final Touches 
Once youâ€™ve recorded your video, consider adding some music, transitions, captions, and other additional nice touches! iMovie, Camtasia, or other tools can assist with this.

Tip ðŸ’¡: Music must be used legally! Speak with your manager/team about using tools for music licensing like Epidemic Sound.
