# Build a Website to Showcase your Resume

## Overview

Want to make your application stand out to recruiters and learn a few new skills in the process? This workshop will walk you through how to code a resume website. The best part is that you don't have to download any coding tools or know any programming languages to get started. 

Using the power of github.dev, a service that allows you to work with files in GitHub, and GitHub Pages, you'll code a resume website using only your browser window. By the end of the workshop, you'll be able to send anyone a link where they can view your resume online.
