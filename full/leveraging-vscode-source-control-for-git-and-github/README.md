## Prerequisites

- Software
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?WT.mc_id=academic-56602-chrhar)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


## What students will learn

- Understands VS Code Interface
- Perform basic Git tasks
   -  Initialize
   - Branch actions
   - Stages
   - Remote


### Introducing VS Code

You will start by exploring the VS code [Getting Started in Visual Studio ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/develop-web-apps-with-vs-code/).

### Create a working directory/folder

Open the folder in VS Code

### Create New file and add content

Add files to be tracked in the working directory and click the source control tab to initialize git

### Initialize Git

This will create a .git folder in your working direcory which gives git to track everything in the directory. This is done once for a single project

### Add Commit and Publish to the GitHub
