# Exploring Contoso Real Estate project with Codespaces and Azure Static Web Apps

_Execute Contoso Real Estate on Codespaces and deploy to Azure Static Web Apps._ ‚ú®

## About Contoso Real Estate

[Contoso Real Estate](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate) is an open source JavaScript reference project that features a composite architecture with eight key scenarios targeted at companies looking for robust and scalable solutions. 

The project demonstrates best development practices such as the use of monorepo (to coordinate multiple teams and projects), devcontainers (for Codespaces), integrated documentation (to make code easier to explore), micro-frontends, and much more.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

To follow this workshop, you will need some basic programming knowledge and access to some tools:

- Azure account: [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=academic-101248-cyzanon) or [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academic-101248-cyzanon)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-101248-cyzanon)
- [JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/shows/beginners-series-to-javascript/?WT.mc_id=academic-101248-cyzanon)
- [Node](https://learn.microsoft.com/shows/beginners-series-to-nodejs/?WT.mc_id=academic-101248-cyzanon)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/?WT.mc_id=academic-101248-cyzanon)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)

> Students can claim the GitHub Student Developer Pack at [GitHub Student Developer Pack ‚Äî GitHub Education](https://aka.ms/Copilot4Students). This offer includes access to Codespaces, GitHub Copilot, Azure for Students, and other benefits. If you are not a student, you can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/?WT.mc_id=academic-101248-cyzanon) for 60 free hours per month.

## GitHub Codespaces

Using Codespaces, you get [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-80067-sagibbon) in the cloud, using a ["development container"](https://containers.dev/). Like a locally running version of [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-80067-sagibbon), the cloud version also allows you to install extensions and use a terminal.

You can also configure your development container to run a specific runtime and have it boot up with your favorite extensions.

## üèÉ Deploy in Azure Static Web Apps

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/app-service/static/?WT.mc_id=academic-101248-cyzanon) is Microsoft's hosting solution for static sites (or sites that are rendered in the user's browser, not on a server) through Azure. This service provides additional opportunities to expand your site through Azure Functions, authentication, staging versions and more.

This workshop includes the setup needed for you to deploy **free** to [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/app-service/static/?WT.mc_id=academic-101248-cyzanon).
